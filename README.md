# Python Chess Engine

This is a chess engine that I created using Python's tkinter graphical user interface. The chess engine implements a minimax + alpha/beta pruning algorithm. This is my first python project that I have ever made, so there might be a few kinks that need a little bit of work. Other than that, I learned a ton from my experience of creating this chess engine. I learned about doing object oriented programming and making a graphical user interface (GUI). Chess has always been a huge hobby of mine ever since I was a little kid, and it is really cool to create a chess engine like the ones that I used for learning the game.

This project was created April 17th 2020

## Getting Started

The main chess engine program is the file named "ChessPythonMainProgram.py". The user plays white and the chess engine plays black.

There is also a 2 player version in the file named "ChessPython2Player.py".
