# Python Chess Engine

This is a chess engine that I created using Python's tkinter graphical user interface. This is my first python project that I have ever made, so there might be a few kinks that need a little bit of work. Other than that, I learned a ton from my experience of creating this chess engine. I learned about doing object oriented programming, defining python functions that involve loops and recursion, and making a graphical user interface (GUI). I also got to learn about the minimax + alpha/beta pruning algorithm.

## Getting Started

The main chess engine program is the file named "ChessPythonMainProgram.py"
